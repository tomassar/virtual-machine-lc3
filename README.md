# LC-3 Virtual Machine

The LC-3 Virtual Machine is a project aimed at simulating the functionality of the LC-3 computer architecture. It allows users to write and execute programs written in LC-3 assembly language within a simulated environment.
## Overview

The LC-3 is a simple computer architecture used for educational purposes to teach the basics of computer organization and assembly language programming. This virtual machine project provides a practical implementation of the LC-3 architecture, allowing users to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.
## Features

- LC-3 Instruction Set Simulation: The virtual machine supports the entire LC-3 instruction set, including arithmetic and logical operations, memory access, branching, and trap instructions.
- Memory and Register Simulation: Simulates the memory and registers of the LC-3, providing a realistic environment for executing programs.
- User-Friendly Interface: The virtual machine includes a simple command-line interface for loading programs, executing instructions, and viewing program output.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Written in C, the virtual machine is designed to run on multiple platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Usage

To use the LC-3 Virtual Machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler such as GCC.
3. Run the compiled executable and load an LC-3 program file.
4. Use the provided commands to execute instructions, view program output, and interact with the simulated environment.
